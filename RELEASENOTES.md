* [HBASE-26561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-26561) | *Major* | **[hbase-operator-tools] Upgrade log4j2 to 2.15.0 to address CVE-2021-44228**

Upgrade log4j2 to 2.15.0 for addressing CVE-2021-44228.


---

* [HBASE-26338](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-26338) | *Major* | **hbck2 setRegionState cannot set replica region state**

To set the replica region's state, it needs the primary region's
encoded regionname and replica id, the command will be "setRegionState <PRIMARY_ENCODED_REGIONNAME>,<replicaId> <STATE>".


---

* [HBASE-25874](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-25874) | *Major* | **[hbase-operator-tools]Add tool for identifying "unknown servers" from master logs, then submit SCPs for each of those.**

RegionsOnUnknownServersRecoverer parses the master log to identify unknown servers with regions assigned with, in meta table. This condition may happen in the event of recovering previously destroyed clusters, where new Master/RS names completely differ from the previous ones currently stored in meta table (see HBASE-24286).

NOTE: This tool is useful for clusters runing hbase versions lower than 2.2.7, 2.3.5 and 2.4.7.
For any of these versions or higher, HBCK2 'recoverUnknown' option can be used as a much simpler solution.

This tool requires the master logs path as parameter. Assuming classpath is properly set, can be run as follows:

$ hbase org.apache.hbase.RegionsOnUnknownServersRecoverer PATH_TO_MASTER_LOGS [dryRun]

The dryRun optional parameter will just parse the logs and print the list of unknown servers, without invoking hbck2 scheduleRecoveries command.

RegionsOnUnknownServersRecoverer parses master log file searching for specific messages mentioning "unknown servers". Once "unknown servers" are found, it then uses HBCK2.scheduleRecoveries to submit SCPs for each of these "unknown servers".

* [HBASE-26338](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-26338) | *Major* | **hbck2 setRegionState cannot set replica region state**

To set the replica region's state, it needs the primary region's
encoded regionname and replica id, the command will be "setRegionState <PRIMARY_ENCODED_REGIONNAME>,<replicaId> <STATE>".


# HBASE  hbase-operator-tools-1.1.0 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-24482](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-24482) | *Major* | **[hbase-operator-tools] build of hbck2 fails with HBase branch-2.3, due to missing dependencies**

Make it so tests and compile works against hbase-2.3.x as well as hbase-2.1.x.


---

* [HBASE-23927](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23927) | *Major* | **hbck2 assigns command should accept one or more files containing a list of region names**

This adds a new option -i or --inputFile to assigns function to allow one or more files to read the region list from for region assignment. Each file contains encoded region names, one per line. White spaces will be trimmed. For example:
     $ HBCK2 assigns -i file1 file2
The files can be generated or piped from operator running grep/sed over log files.


---

* [HBASE-23180](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23180) | *Major* | **Add a hbck2 testing tool**

This adds a new tool that spins up hbase on hadoop minicluster and mimicks actions of hbck2 to verify it's functionalities. The tool has been designed for easy addition of more compound actions (i.e. collection of actions) to verify hbck2.Â deleteRegionInMeta.sh is one such example of a compound action script.


---

* [HBASE-23610](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23610) | *Trivial* | **Update Apache POM to version 21 for hbase-operator-tools**

Updated parent POM from version 18 to version 21 - https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent/compare/apache-18...apache-21


---

* [HBASE-23577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23577) | *Minor* | **Bump Checkstyle from 8.11 to 8.18 in hbase-operator-tools**

Bumped the Checkstyle version from 8.11 to 8.18



# HBASE  hbase-operator-tools-1.0.0 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-23002](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-23002) | *Major* | **[HBCK2/hbase-operator-tools] Create an assembly that builds an hbase-operator-tools tgz**

First cut at an assembly for hbase-operator-tools project.


---

* [HBASE-22997](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-22997) | *Major* | **Move to SLF4J**

Added SLF4J binding for LOG4J 2.


---

* [HBASE-22567](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-22567) | *Major* | **[HBCK2] Add new methods for dealing with missing regions in META while Master is online**

Adds new, lightweight option for recovering missing regions in meta, "addFsRegionsMissingInMeta" command, as well "readonly" "reportMissingRegionsInMeta" to show the list of regions to be readded in meta. This is a less intrusive alternative to OfflineMetaRepair, can be used when master and meta are still capable of coming online.

Detailed description as provided by the command usage help:

{noformat}
 addFsRegionsMissingInMeta \<NAMESPACE\|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME\>...
   Options:
    -d,--force\_disable aborts fix for table if disable fails.
   To be used in scenarios where some regions may be missing in META,
   but there's still a valid 'regioninfo' metadata file on HDFS.
   This is a lighter version of 'OfflineMetaRepair tool commonly used for
   similar issues on 1.x release line.
   This command needs META to be online. For each table name passed as
   parameter, it performs a diff between regions available in META,
   against existing regions dirs on HDFS. Then, for region dirs with
   no matches in META, it reads regioninfo metadata file and
   re-creates given region in META. Regions are re-created in 'CLOSED'
   state at META table only, but not in Masters' cache, and are not
   assigned either. To get these regions online, run HBCK2
'assigns'command
   printed at the end of this command results for convenience.

   NOTE: If using hbase releases older than 2.3.0, a rolling restart of
   HMasters is needed prior to executing the provided 'assigns' command.

   An example adding missing regions for tables 'tbl\_1' on default
   namespace, 'tbl\_2' on namespace 'n1' and for all tables from
   namespace 'n2':
     $ HBCK2 addFsRegionsMissingInMeta default:tbl\_1 n1:tbl\_2 n2
   Returns HBCK2 'assigns' command with all re-inserted regions.
   SEE ALSO: reportMissingRegionsInMeta
...
 reportMissingRegionsInMeta \<NAMESPACE\|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME\>...
   To be used in scenarios where some regions may be missing in META,
   but there's still a valid 'regioninfo metadata file on HDFS.
   This is a checking only method, designed for reporting purposes and
   doesn't perform any fixes, providing a view of which regions (if any)
   would get re-added to meta, grouped by respective table/namespace.
   To effectively re-add regions in meta, addFsRegionsMissingInMeta should be executed.
   This command needs META to be online. For each namespace/table passed
   as parameter, it performs a diff between regions available in META,
   against existing regions dirs on HDFS. Region dirs with no matches
   are printed grouped under its related table name. Tables with no
   missing regions will show a 'no missing regions' message. If no
   namespace or table is specified, it will verify all existing regions.
   It accepts a combination of multiple namespace and tables. Table names
   should include the namespace portion, even for tables in the default
   namespace, otherwise it will assume as a namespace value.
   An example triggering missing regions report for tables 'table\_1'
   and 'table\_2', under default namespace:
     $ HBCK2 reportMissingRegionsInMeta default:table\_1 default:table\_2
   An example triggering missing regions report for table 'table\_1'
   under default namespace, and for all tables from namespace 'ns1':
     $ HBCK2 reportMissingRegionsInMeta default:table\_1 ns1
   Returns list of missing regions for each table passed as parameter, or
   for each table on namespaces specified as parameter.

* [HBASE-21210](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21210) | *Major* | **Add bypassProcedure() API to HBCK2**

Added a bypass to hbck2:

{code}
$ HBASE\_CLASSPATH\_PREFIX=../hbase-operator-tools/hbase-hbck2/target/hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ./bin/hbase org.apache.hbase.HBCK2
usage: HBCK2 [OPTIONS] COMMAND \<ARGS\>

Options:
 -d,--debug                                 run with debug output
 -h,--help                                  output this help message
 -p,--hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort   peerport of target hbase
                                            ensemble
 -q,--hbase.zookeeper.quorum \<arg\>          ensemble of target hbase
 -z,--zookeeper.znode.parent                parent znode of target hbase

Commands:
 setTableState \<TABLENAME\> \<STATE\>
   Possible table states: ENABLED, DISABLED, DISABLING, ENABLING
   To read current table state, in the hbase shell run:
     hbase\> get 'hbase:meta', '\<TABLENAME\>', 'table:state'
   A value of \\x08\\x00 == ENABLED, \\x08\\x01 == DISABLED, etc.
   An example making table name 'user' ENABLED:
     $ HBCK2 setTableState users ENABLED
   Returns whatever the previous table state was.

 assigns \<ENCODED\_REGIONNAME\>...
   A 'raw' assign that can be used even during Master initialization.
   Skirts Coprocessors. Pass one or more encoded RegionNames:
   e.g. 1588230740 is hard-coded encoding for hbase:meta region and
   de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4 is an example of what a random
   user-space encoded Region name looks like. For example:
     $ HBCK2 assign 1588230740 de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4
   Returns the pid of the created AssignProcedure or -1 if none.

 bypass [OPTIONS] \<PID\>...
   Pass one (or more) procedure 'pid's to skip to the procedure finish.
   Parent of this procedures will also skip to its finish. Entities will
   be left in an inconsistent state and will require manual fixup.
   Pass --force to break any outstanding locks.
   Pass --waitTime=\<seconds\> to wait on entity lock before giving up.
   Default: force=false and waitTime=0. Returns true if succeeded.

 unassigns \<ENCODED\_REGIONNAME\>...
   A 'raw' unassign that can be used even during Master initialization.
   Skirts Coprocessors. Pass one or more encoded RegionNames:
   Skirts Coprocessors. Pass one or more encoded RegionNames:
   de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4 is an example of what a random
   user-space encoded Region name looks like. For example:
     $ HBCK2 unassign 1588230740 de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4
   Returns the pid of the created UnassignProcedure or -1 if none.
