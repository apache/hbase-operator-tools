# Apache HBase Tool for repair metadata

_MetaRepair_ is an utility tool for repairing hbase metadata table from hdfs regioninfo file.
When using the [Apache HBase&trade;](https://hbase.apache.org)
versions before 2.0.3 and 2.1.1 (**Without HBCK2**), You can use it to fix the HBase metadata correctly.

## Build

Run:
```
$ mvn install
```
The built _hbase-meta-repair_ jar will be in the `target` sub-directory.

## Setup
Make sure HBase tools jar is added to HBase classpath:

```
export HBASE_CLASSPATH=$HBASE_CLASSPATH:./hbase-meta-repair-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Usage

_MetaRepair_ requires an arguments as parameters: The name of the table
to have metadata repaired.

For example, to repair metadata of table `my-table` , assuming the _setup_ step above has been performed:

```
$ hbase org.apache.hbase.repair.MetaRepair my-table
```
> The table with _namespace_ use `namespace:tablename` form of parameter.

## Implementation Details

HBase uses table `hbase:meta` to store metadata. The table structure is as follows:

|  Column |  Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| info:state | region state |
| info:sn | region server node, It consists of server and serverstartcode, such as `slave1,16020,1557998852385` |
| info:serverstartcode | region server start timestamp |
| info:server | region server address and portï¼Œsuch as `slave1:16020` |
| info:seqnumDuringOpen | a binary string representing the online duration of the region |
| info:regioninfo | same as the `.regioninfo` file |

> `info:seqnumDuringOpen` and `info:serverstartcode` will be automatically generated after the region server is restarted.
