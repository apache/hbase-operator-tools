# Apache HBase HBCK2 Tool

_HBCK2_ is the repair tool for Apache HBase clusters.

Problems in operation are bugs. The need for an _HBCK2_ fix
is meant as workaround until the bug is fixed and deployed
in a new hbase version.

## _HBCK2_ vs _hbck1_
HBCK2 is the successor to [hbck](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hbck.in.depth),
the repair tool that shipped with _hbase-1.x_ (A.K.A _hbck1_).  Use _HBCK2_ in place of
_hbck1_ making repairs against hbase-2.x clusters. _hbck1_ should not be run against an
hbase-2.x install. It may do damage. While _hbck1_ is still bundled inside hbase-2.x
-- to minimize surprise -- it is deprecated, to be removed in _hbase-3.x_. Its
write-facility (`-fix`) has been removed. It can report on the state of an hbase-2.x
cluster but its assessments will be inaccurate since it does not understand the internal
workings of an hbase-2.x.

_HBCK2_ does not work the way _hbck1_ used to, even for the case where commands are
similarly named across the two versions. See the next section for how the tools
differ.

## Philosophy
_HBCK2_ performs a single, discrete task each time it is run. It does not presume
a tool can analyze all about the running cluster and then repair 'all problems' found as
_hbck1_ used suggest.

_HBCK2_ is for fixes. For listings of inconsistencies or blockages in the running cluster,
you go elsewhere, to the logs and UI of the running cluster Master. Once an issue has been identified,
you use the _HBCK2_ tool to ask the Master to effect fixes or to skip-over bad state. Asking the
Master to make the fixes rather than try and effect the repair locally in a fix-it
tool's context is another important difference between _HBCK2_ and _hbck1_. More on how this
interactive fix-it process works and on _HBCK2_ workings can be found in sections that follow.

## Obtaining _HBCK2_
Releases can be found under the HBase distribution directory. See the
[HBASE Downloads Page](http://hbase.apache.org/downloads.html).

## Building _HBCK2_

Run:
```
$ mvn install
```
The built _HBCK2_ jar will be in the `target` sub-directory.

## Running _HBCK2_
The _HBCK2_ jar does not include dependencies; it is not built as a 'fat' jar.
Dependencies must be `provided`. Building, adjusting the target hbase version in the
top-level pom to match your deploy will make for the smoothest operation when run
against your deploy (See the parent pom.xml `hbase-operator-tools` for the
[hbase.version to set](https://github.com/apache/hbase-operator-tools/blob/master/pom.xml#L126)).

Where runtime interaction between _HBCK2_ and running cluster can get interesting is
when _HBCK2_ is in advance of your hbase deploy such that your hbase does not support
all APIs in current _HBCK2_. Where _HBCK2_ does not have needed server-side support
it should fail gracefully. Use an older release or upgrade your cluster (if you can).

The easiest means of 'providing' _HBCK2_ its dependencies is by launching
_HBCK2_ via the `$HBASE_HOME/bin/hbase` script. The `bin/hbase` script natively
makes mention of `hbck` -- there is a `hbck` option listed in the help output.
By default, running `bin/hbase hbck`, the built-in _hbck1_ tooling will be run.
To run _HBCK2_, you need to point at a built _HBCK2_ jar using the `-j` option
as in:
~~~~
 $  ${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase --config /etc/hbase-conf hbck -j ~/hbase-operator-tools/hbase-hbck2/target/hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
~~~~
where in the above, `/etc/hbase-conf` is where the deploy's configuration lives.
The _HBCK2_ jar is at
`~/hbase-operator-tools/hbase-hbck2/target/hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
The above command with no options or arguments passed will dump out the _HBCK2_ help:
```

Command:
 addFsRegionsMissingInMeta <NAMESPACE|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME>...
   Options:
    -d,--force_disable aborts fix for table if disable fails.
   To be used when regions missing from hbase:meta but directories
   are present still in HDFS. Can happen if user has run _hbck1_
   'OfflineMetaRepair' against an hbase-2.x cluster. Needs hbase:meta
   to be online. For each table name passed as parameter, performs diff
   between regions available in hbase:meta and region dirs on HDFS.
   Then for dirs with no hbase:meta matches, it reads the 'regioninfo'
   metadata file and re-creates given region in hbase:meta. Regions are
   re-created in 'CLOSED' state in the hbase:meta table, but not in the
   Masters' cache, and they are not assigned either. To get these
   regions online, run the HBCK2 'assigns'command printed when this
   command-run completes.
   NOTE: If using hbase releases older than 2.3.0, a rolling restart of
   HMasters is needed prior to executing the set of 'assigns' output.
   An example adding missing regions for tables 'tbl_1' in the default
   namespace, 'tbl_2' in namespace 'n1' and for all tables from
   namespace 'n2':
     $ HBCK2 addFsRegionsMissingInMeta default:tbl_1 n1:tbl_2 n2
   Returns HBCK2  an 'assigns' command with all re-inserted regions.

 assigns [OPTIONS] <ENCODED_REGIONNAME/INPUTFILES_FOR_REGIONNAMES>...
   Options:
    -o,--override  override ownership by another procedure
    -i,--inputFiles  take one or more encoded region names
   A 'raw' assign that can be used even during Master initialization (if
   the -skip flag is specified). Skirts Coprocessors. Pass one or more
   encoded region names. 1588230740 is the hard-coded name for the
   hbase:meta region and de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4 is an example of
   what a user-space encoded region name looks like. For example:
     $ HBCK2 assigns 1588230740 de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4
   Returns the pid(s) of the created AssignProcedure(s) or -1 if none.
   If -i or --inputFiles is specified, pass one or more input file names.
   Each file contains encoded region names, one per line. For example:
     $ HBCK2 -i assigns fileName1 fileName2
 bypass [OPTIONS] <PID>...
   Options:
    -o,--override   override if procedure is running/stuck
    -r,--recursive  bypass parent and its children. SLOW! EXPENSIVE!
    -w,--lockWait   milliseconds to wait before giving up; default=1
    -i, --inputFile   take one or more files to read the args from
   Pass one (or more) procedure 'pid's to skip to procedure finish. Parent
   of bypassed procedure will also be skipped to the finish. Entities will
   be left in an inconsistent state and will require manual fixup. May
   need Master restart to clear locks still held. Bypass fails if
   procedure has children. Add 'recursive' if all you have is a parent pid
   to finish parent and children. This is SLOW, and dangerous so use
   selectively. Does not always work.

 extraRegionsInMeta <NAMESPACE|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME>...
   Options:
    -f, --fix    fix meta by removing all extra regions found.
   Reports regions present on hbase:meta, but with no related
   directories on the file system. Needs hbase:meta to be online.
   For each table name passed as parameter, performs diff
   between regions available in hbase:meta and region dirs on the given
   file system. Extra regions would get deleted from Meta
   if passed the --fix option.
   NOTE: Before deciding on use the "--fix" option, it's worth check if
   reported extra regions are overlapping with existing valid regions.
   If so, then "extraRegionsInMeta --fix" is indeed the optimal solution.
   Otherwise, "assigns" command is the simpler solution, as it recreates
   regions dirs in the filesystem, if not existing.
   An example triggering extra regions report for tables 'table_1'
   and 'table_2', under default namespace:
     $ HBCK2 extraRegionsInMeta default:table_1 default:table_2
   An example triggering extra regions report for table 'table_1'
   under default namespace, and for all tables from namespace 'ns1':
     $ HBCK2 extraRegionsInMeta default:table_1 ns1
   Returns list of extra regions for each table passed as parameter, or
   for each table on namespaces specified as parameter.

 filesystem [OPTIONS] [<TABLENAME>...]
   Options:
    -f, --fix    sideline corrupt hfiles, bad links, and references.
   Report on corrupt hfiles, references, broken links, and integrity.
   Pass '--fix' to sideline corrupt files and links. '--fix' does NOT
   fix integrity issues; i.e. 'holes' or 'orphan' regions. Pass one or
   more tablenames to narrow checkup. Default checks all tables and
   restores 'hbase.version' if missing. Interacts with the filesystem
   only! Modified regions need to be reopened to pick-up changes.

 fixMeta
   Do a server-side fix of bad or inconsistent state in hbase:meta.
   Available in hbase 2.2.1/2.1.6 or newer versions. Master UI has
   matching, new 'HBCK Report' tab that dumps reports generated by
   most recent run of _catalogjanitor_ and a new 'HBCK Chore'. It
   is critical that hbase:meta first be made healthy before making
   any other repairs. Fixes 'holes', 'overlaps', etc., creating
   (empty) region directories in HDFS to match regions added to
   hbase:meta. Command is NOT the same as the old _hbck1_ command
   named similarily. Works against the reports generated by the last
   catalog_janitor and hbck chore runs. If nothing to fix, run is a
   noop. Otherwise, if 'HBCK Report' UI reports problems, a run of
   fixMeta will clear up hbase:meta issues. See 'HBase HBCK' UI
   for how to generate new report.
   SEE ALSO: reportMissingRegionsInMeta

 replication [OPTIONS] [<TABLENAME>...]
   Options:
    -f, --fix    fix any replication issues found.
   Looks for undeleted replication queues and deletes them if passed the
   '--fix' option. Pass a table name to check for replication barrier and
   purge if '--fix'.

 reportMissingRegionsInMeta <NAMESPACE|NAMESPACE:TABLENAME>...
   To be used when regions missing from hbase:meta but directories
   are present still in HDFS. Can happen if user has run _hbck1_
   'OfflineMetaRepair' against an hbase-2.x cluster. This is a CHECK only
   method, designed for reporting purposes and doesn't perform any
   fixes, providing a view of which regions (if any) would get re-added
   to hbase:meta, grouped by respective table/namespace. To effectively
   re-add regions in meta, run addFsRegionsMissingInMeta.
   This command needs hbase:meta to be online. For each namespace/table
   passed as parameter, it performs a diff between regions available in
   hbase:meta against existing regions dirs on HDFS. Region dirs with no
   matches are printed grouped under its related table name. Tables with
   no missing regions will show a 'no missing regions' message. If no
   namespace or table is specified, it will verify all existing regions.
   It accepts a combination of multiple namespace and tables. Table names
   should include the namespace portion, even for tables in the default
   namespace, otherwise it will assume as a namespace value.
   An example triggering missing regions report for tables 'table_1'
   and 'table_2', under default namespace:
     $ HBCK2 reportMissingRegionsInMeta default:table_1 default:table_2
   An example triggering missing regions report for table 'table_1'
   under default namespace, and for all tables from namespace 'ns1':
     $ HBCK2 reportMissingRegionsInMeta default:table_1 ns1
   Returns list of missing regions for each table passed as parameter, or
   for each table on namespaces specified as parameter.

 setRegionState <ENCODED_REGIONNAME> <STATE>
   Possible region states:
    OFFLINE, OPENING, OPEN, CLOSING, CLOSED, SPLITTING, SPLIT,
    FAILED_OPEN, FAILED_CLOSE, MERGING, MERGED, SPLITTING_NEW,
    MERGING_NEW, ABNORMALLY_CLOSED
   WARNING: This is a very risky option intended for use as last resort.
   Example scenarios include unassigns/assigns that can't move forward
   because region is in an inconsistent state in 'hbase:meta'. For
   example, the 'unassigns' command can only proceed if passed a region
   in one of the following states: SPLITTING|SPLIT|MERGING|OPEN|CLOSING
   Before manually setting a region state with this command, please
   certify that this region is not being handled by a running procedure,
   such as 'assign' or 'split'. You can get a view of running procedures
   in the hbase shell using the 'list_procedures' command. An example
   setting region 'de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4' to CLOSING:
     $ HBCK2 setRegionState de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4 CLOSING
   Returns "0" if region state changed and "1" otherwise.

 setTableState <TABLENAME> <STATE>
   Possible table states: ENABLED, DISABLED, DISABLING, ENABLING
   To read current table state, in the hbase shell run:
     hbase> get 'hbase:meta', '<TABLENAME>', 'table:state'
   A value of \x08\x00 == ENABLED, \x08\x01 == DISABLED, etc.
   Can also run a 'describe "<TABLENAME>"' at the shell prompt.
   An example making table name 'user' ENABLED:
     $ HBCK2 setTableState users ENABLED
   Returns whatever the previous table state was.

 scheduleRecoveries <SERVERNAME>...
   Schedule ServerCrashProcedure(SCP) for list of RegionServers. Format
   server name as '<HOSTNAME>,<PORT>,<STARTCODE>' (See HBase UI/logs).
   Example using RegionServer 'a.example.org,29100,1540348649479':
     $ HBCK2 scheduleRecoveries a.example.org,29100,1540348649479
   Returns the pid(s) of the created ServerCrashProcedure(s) or -1 if
   no procedure created (see master logs for why not).
   Command support added in hbase versions 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.0 or newer.

 unassigns <ENCODED_REGIONNAME>...
   Options:
    -o,--override  override ownership by another procedure
   A 'raw' unassign that can be used even during Master initialization
   (if the -skip flag is specified). Skirts Coprocessors. Pass one or
   more encoded region names. 1588230740 is the hard-coded name for the
   hbase:meta region and de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4 is an example
   of what a userspace encoded region name looks like. For example:
     $ HBCK2 unassign 1588230740 de00010733901a05f5a2a3a382e27dd4
   Returns the pid(s) of the created UnassignProcedure(s) or -1 if none.
   If -i or --inputFiles is specified, pass one or more input file names.
   Each file contains encoded region names, one per line. For example:
     $ HBCK2 -i unassigns fileName1 fileName2

   SEE ALSO, org.apache.hbase.hbck1.OfflineMetaRepair, the offline
   hbase:meta tool. See the HBCK2 README for how to use.
```
Note that when you pass `bin/hbase` the `hbck` argument, it will by
default use the shaded client to get to the targeted hbase cluster.
This is sufficient for most _HBCK2_ usage. If you run into complaints
like the below:
```
bin/hbase --config hbase-conf  hbck
2019-08-30 05:04:54,467 WARN  [main] util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable

        at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.HBaseFsck.main(HBaseFsck.java:3605)
```
... it is because the HDFS jars are not on the CLASSPATH. The default is NOT
to bundle HDFS jars on the CLASSPATH when running `hbck` via `bin/hbase`. Define
`HADOOP_HOME` in the environment so `bin/hbase` can find your local hadoop
install and then it will load its HDFS jars.

## _HBCK2_ Overview
_HBCK2_ is currently a simple tool that does one thing at a time only.

In hbase-2.x, the Master is the final arbiter of all state, so a general principal for most
_HBCK2_ commands is that it asks the Master to effect all repair. This means a Master must be
up before you can run _HBCK2_ commands.

The _HBCK2_ implementation approach is to make use of an
`HbckService` hosted on the Master. The Service publishes a few methods for the _HBCK2_ tool to
pull on. Therefore, for _HBCK2_ commands relying on Master's `HbckService` facade,
first thing _HBCK2_ does is poke the cluster to ensure the service is available.
This will fail if the remote Server does not publish the Service or if the
`HbckService` is lacking the requested method. For the latter case, if you can,
update your cluster to obtain more fix facility.

_HBCK2_ versions should be able to work across multiple hbase-2 releases. It will
fail with a complaint if it is unable to run. There is no `HbckService` in versions
of hbase before 2.0.3 and 2.1.1. _HBCK2_ will not work against these versions.

Next we look first at how you 'find' issues in your running cluster followed by
a section on how you 'fix' found problems.

## Finding Problems

While _hbck1_ performed analysis reporting your cluster GOOD or BAD, _HBCK2_
is less presumptious. In hbase-2.x, the operator figures what needs fixing and
then uses tooling including _HBCK2_ to do fixup. The operator may have to go
a few rounds of back and forth running _HBCK2_ then checking cluster state.

To figure cluster issues, make use of the following utilities and emissions.

### Diagnosis Tooling

#### Master Logs

The Master runs all assignments, server crash handling, cluster start and
stop, etc. In hbase-2.x, all that the Master does has been cast as
Procedures run on a state machine engine. See
[Procedure Framework](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#pv2)
and [Assignment Manager](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#amv2)
for detail on how this new infrastructure works. Each Procedure has a
unique Procedure `id`, its `pid`, that it lists on each logging.
Following the _pid_, you can trace the lifecycle of a Procedure in the
Master logs as Procedures transition from start, through each of the
Procedure's various stages to finish. Some Procedures spawn sub-procedures,
wait on their Children, and then themselves finish. Each child logs
its _pid_ but also its _ppid_; its parent's _pid_.

Generally all run problem free but if some unforeseen circumstance
arises, the assignment framework may sustain damage requiring
operator intervention.  Below we will discuss some such scenarios
but they can manifest in the Master log as a Region being _STUCK_ or
a Procedure transitioning an entity -- a Region or a Table --
may be blocked because another Procedure holds the exclusive lock
and is not letting go.

_STUCK_ Procedures look like this:

```
2018-09-12 15:29:06,558 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.assignment.AssignmentManager: STUCK Region-In-Transition rit=OPENING, location=va1001.example.org,22101,1536173230599, table=IntegrationTestBigLinkedList_20180626110336, region=dbdb56242f17610c46ea044f7a42895b
```

#### Master UI: /master-status#tables

This section about midway down in Master UI home-page shows a list of tables
with columns for whether the table is _ENABLED_, _ENABLING_, _DISABLING_, or
_DISABLED_ among other attributes. Also listed are columns with counts
of Regions in their various transition states: _OPEN_, _CLOSED_,
etc. A read of this table is good for figuring if the Regions of
this table have a proper disposition. For example if a table is
_ENABLED_ and there are Regions that are not in the _OPEN_ state
and the Master Log is silent about any ongoing assigns, then
something is amiss.

#### Master UI: 'Procedures & Locks'

This page off the Master UI home page under the
_Procedures & Locks_ menu item in the page heading lists all ongoing
Procedures and Locks as well as the current set of Master Procedure WALs
(named _pv2-0000000000000000###.log_ under the _MasterProcWALs_
directory in your hbase install). On startup, on a large
cluster when furious assigning is afoot, this page is
filled with lists of Procedures and Locks. The count of
MasterProcWALs will bloat too. If after the cluster settles,
there is a stuck Lock or Procedure or the count of WALs
doesn't ever come down but only grows, then operator intervention
is needed to alieve the blockage.

Lists of locks and procedures can also be obtained via the hbase shell:

```
$ echo "list_locks"| hbase shell &> /tmp/locks.txt
$ echo "list_procedures"| hbase shell &> /tmp/procedures.txt
```

#### Master UI: The 'HBCK Report'
An `HBCK Report` page was added to the Master in versions hbase 2.3.0/2.1.6/2.2.1
at `/hbck.jsp`
which shows output from two inspections run by the master on an interval; one
is output by the CatalogJanitor whenever it runs. If overlaps or holes in
`hbase:meta`, the CatalogJanitor half of the page will list what it has found
(otherwise it is quiet). Another background 'chore' process was added to compare
`hbase:meta` and filesystem content making compare; if anomaly, it will make
note in its `HBCK Report` section.

See the 'HBCK Report' page itself for how to force runs of the inspectors.


#### The [HBase Canary Tool](http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#_canary)

The Canary tool is useful verifying the state of assign.
It can be run with a table focus or against the whole cluster.

For example, to check cluster assigns:

```
$ hbase canary -f false -t 6000000 &>/tmp/canary.log
```

The _-f false_ tells the Canary to keep going across failed Region
fetches and the _-t 6000000_ tells the Canary run for ~two hours
maximum. When done, check out _/tmp/canary.log_. Grep for
_ERROR_ lines to find problematic Region assigns.

You can do a probe like the Canary's in the hbase shell. 
For example, given a Region that has a start row of _d1dddd0c_
belonging to the table _testtable_, do as follows:


```
hbase> scan 'testtable', {STARTROW => 'd1dddd0c', LIMIT => 10}
```

For an overview on parsing a Region name into its constituent parts, see
[RegionInfo API](https://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/RegionInfo.html).

#### Other Tools

To figure the list of Regions that are not _OPEN_ on an
_ENABLED_ or _ENABLING_ table, read the _hbase:meta_ table _info:state_ column.
For example, to find the state of all Regions in the table
_IntegrationTestBigLinkedList_20180626064758_, do the following:

```
$ echo " scan 'hbase:meta', {ROWPREFIXFILTER => 'IntegrationTestBigLinkedList_20180626064758,', COLUMN => 'info:state'}"| hbase shell > /tmp/t.txt
```

...then grep for _OPENING_ or _CLOSING_ Regions.

To move an _OPENING_ issue to _OPEN_ so it agrees with a table's
_ENABLED_ state, use the `assign` command in the hbase shell to
queue a new Assign Procedure (watch the Master logs to see the
Assign run). If many Regions to assign, use the _HBCK2_ tool. It
can do bulk assigning.

## Fixing Problems

### Some General Principals
When making repair, make sure hbase:meta is consistent first
before you go about fixing any other issue type such as a filesystem
deviance. Deviance in the filesystem or problems with assign should
be addressed after the hbase:meta has been put in order. If hbase:meta
is out of whack, the Master cannot make proper placements when adopting orphan
filesystem data or making region assignments.

Other general principals to keep in mind include a Region can not be assigned if
it is in _CLOSING_ state (or the inverse, unassigned if in _OPENING_ state) without
first transitioning via _CLOSED_: Regions must always move from _CLOSED_, to _OPENING_,
to _OPEN_, and then to _CLOSING_, _CLOSED_.

When making repair, do fixup of a table-at-a-time.

Also, if a table is _DISABLED_, you cannot assign a Region.
In the Master logs, you will see that the Master will report
that the assign has been skipped because the table is
_DISABLED_. You may want to assign a Region because it is
currently in the _OPENING_ state and you want it in the
_CLOSED_ state so it agrees with the table's _DISABLED_
state. In this situation, you may have to temporarily set
the table status to _ENABLED_, just so you can do the
assign, and then set it back again after the unassign.
_HBCK2_ has facility to allow you do this. See the
_HBCK2_ usage output.

What follows is a mix of notes and prescription that comes of experience running hbase-2.x so far.
The root issues that brought on states described below has been fixed in later versions of hbase
so upgrade if you can so as to avoid secenarios described.

### Assigning/Unassigning

Generally, on assign, the Master will persist until successful.
An assign takes an exclusive lock on the Region. This precludes
a concurrent assign or unassign from running. An assign against
a locked Region will wait until the lock is released before
making progress. See the [Procedures & Locks] section above for
current list of outstanding Locks.

### _Master startup cannot progress, in holding-pattern until region onlined_

This should never happen. If it does, here is what it looks like:

```
2018-10-01 22:07:42,792 WARN org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster: hbase:meta,,1.1588230740 is NOT online; state={1588230740 state=CLOSING, ts=1538456302300, server=ve1017.example.org,22101,1538449648131}; ServerCrashProcedures=true. Master startup cannot progress, in holding-pattern until region onlined.
```

The Master is unable to continue startup because there is no Procedure to assign
_hbase:meta_ (or _hbase:namespace_). To inject one, use the _HBCK2_ tool:

```
HBASE_CLASSPATH_PREFIX=./hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar hbase org.apache.hbase.HBCK2 assigns -skip 1588230740
```
...where 1588230740 is the encoded name of the _hbase:meta_ Region. Pass the '-skip' option to
stop HBCK2 doing a verstion check against the remote master. If the remote master is not up,
the version check will prompt a 'Master is initializing response' or 'PleaseHoldException'
and drop the assign attempt. The '-skip' command punts on version check and will land the
scheduled assign.

The same may happen to the _hbase:namespace_ system table. Look for the
encoded Region name of the _hbase:namespace_ Region and do similar to
what we did for _hbase:meta_. In this latter case, the Master actually
prints out a helpful message that looks like the following:

```
2019-07-09 22:08:38,966 WARN  [master/localhost:16000:becomeActiveMaster] master.HMaster: hbase:namespace,,1562733904278.9559cf72b8e81e1291c626a8e781a6ae. is NOT online; state={9559cf72b8e81e1291c626a8e781a6ae state=CLOSED, ts=1562735318897, server=null}; ServerCrashProcedures=true. Master startup cannot progress, in holding-pattern until region onlined.
```

To schedule an assign for the hbase:namespace table noted in the above log line, you would do:
```
 $ ${HBASE_HOME}/bin/hbase --config /etc/hbase-conf hbck -j ./hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar hbase -skip assigns 9559cf72b8e81e1291c626a8e781a6ae
```
... passing the encoded name for the namespace region (the encoded name will differ per deploy).

### Missing Regions in hbase:meta region/table restore/rebuild

There have been some unusual cases where table regions have been removed from hbase:meta table.
Some triage on such cases revealed these were operator-induced. Users had run the obsolete
*hbck1* _OfflineMetaRepair_ tool against an _HBCK2_ cluster. _OfflineMetaRepair_ is a well
known tool for fixing hbase:meta table related issues on HBase 1.x versions. The original
version is not compatible with HBase 2.x or higher versions, and it has undergone some
adjustments so in the extreme, it can now be run via _HBCK2_.

In most of these cases, regions end up missing in hbase:meta at random, but hbase may still be
operational. In such situations, problem can be addressed with the Master online,
using the _addFsRegionsMissingInMeta_ command in _HBCK2_. This command is less disruptive to
hbase than a full hbase:meta rebuild covered later, and it can be used even for
recovering the _namespace_ table region.

### Extra Regions in hbase:meta region/table restore/rebuild

There can also be situations where table regions have been removed file system, but still
have related entries on hbase:meta table. This may happen due to problems on splitting, manual
operation mistakes (like deleting/moving the region dir manually), or even meta info data loss
issues such as HBASE-21843.

Such problem can be addressed with the Master online, using the _extraRegionsInMeta --fix_
command in _HBCK2_. This command is less disruptive to hbase than a full hbase:meta rebuild
covered later. Also useful when this happens on versions that don't support _fixMeta_ hbck2 option
(any prior to "2.0.6", "2.1.6", "2.2.1", "2.3.0","3.0.0").

#### Online hbase:meta rebuild recipe

If hbase:meta corruption is not too critical, hbase would still be able to bring it online. Even if namespace region
is among the missing regions, it will still be possible to scan hbase:meta during the
initialization period, where Master will be waiting for namespace to be assigned.
To verify this situation, a hbase:meta scan command can be executed
as below. If it does not time out or show any errors, _hbase:meta_ is online:

```
echo "scan 'hbase:meta', {COLUMN=>'info:regioninfo'}" | hbase shell
```

_HBCK2_ _addFsRegionsMissingInMeta_ can be used if the above does not show any errors. It reads region
metadata info available on the FS region directories in order to recreate regions
in hbase:meta. Since it can run with hbase partially operational, it attempts to disable online tables
that are affected by the reported problem and it is going to readd regions to _hbase:meta_.
It can check for specific tables/namespaces, or all tables from all namespaces.
An example below shows adding missing regions for tables 'tbl_1' in the default namespace,
'tbl_2' in namespace 'n1', and for all tables from namespace 'n2':

```
$ HBCK2 addFsRegionsMissingInMeta default:tbl_1 n1:tbl_2 n2
```

As it operates independently from Master, once it finishes successfully, additional steps are
required to actually have the re-added regions assigned. These are listed below:

1. _addFsRegionsMissingInMeta_ outputs an _assigns_ command with all regions that got re-added. This
command needs to be executed later, so copy and save it for convenience.

2. For HBase versions prior to 2.3.0, after _addFsRegionsMissingInMeta_ finished successfully and output has been saved,
restart all running HBase Masters.

3. Once Master's are restarted and hbase:meta is already online (check if Web UI is accessible), run
_assigns_ command from _addFsRegionsMissingInMeta_ output saved per instructions from #1.

NOTE: If _namespace_ region is among the missing regions, you will need to add _--skip_ flag at the
beginning of _assigns_ command returned.

Should a cluster suffer a catastrophic loss of the `hbase:meta` table, a rough rebuild is possible using the following recipe.
In outline, we stop the cluster; run the _HBCK2_ _OfflineMetaRepair_ tool which reads directories and metadata dropped into the filesystem
making a best effort at reconstructing a viable _hbase:meta_ table; restart your cluster; inject an assign to bring the system
namespace table online; and then finally, re-assign userspace tables you'd like enabled (the rebuilt _hbase:meta_ creates a table with all tables offline and no regions assigned).

#### Detailed rebuild recipe
Stop the cluster.

Run the rebuild _hbase:meta_ command from _HBCK2_. This will move aside the original _hbase:meta_ and put in place a newly rebuilt one. Below is an example of how to run the tool.  It adds the `-details` flag so the tool dumps info on the regions its found in hdfs:
```
$ HBASE_CLASSPATH_PREFIX=~/checkouts/hbase-operator-tools/hbase-hbck2/target/hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ./bin/hbase org.apache.hbase.hbck1.OfflineMetaRepair -details
```

Start the cluster up. It won’t come up fully. It will be stuck because the _namespace_ table is not online and there is no assign procedure in the procedure store for this contingency. The hbase master log will show this state. Here is an example of what it will log:
```
2019-07-10 18:30:51,090 WARN  [master/localhost:16000:becomeActiveMaster] master.HMaster: hbase:namespace,,1562808216225.725a0fe6c2c869d3d0a9ed82bfa80fa3. is NOT online; state={725a0fe6c2c869d3d0a9ed82bfa80fa3 state=CLOSED, ts=1562808619952, server=null}; ServerCrashProcedures=false. Master startup cannot progress, in holding-pattern until region onlined.
```

To assign the namespace table region, you cannot use the shell. If you use the shell, it will fail with a `PleaseHoldException` because the master is not yet up (it is waiting for the namepace table to come online before it declares itself ‘up’). You have to use the `HBCK2` _assigns_ command. To assign, you will need the namespace encoded name. It shows in the log quoted above: i.e. _725a0fe6c2c869d3d0a9ed82bfa80fa3_ in this case. You will also have to pass the -skip command to ‘skip’ the master version check (without it, your `HBCK2` invocation will also elicit the above `PleaseHoldException` because the master is not yet up). Here is an example adding an assign of the namespace table:
```
$ HBASE_CLASSPATH_PREFIX=~/checkouts/hbase-operator-tools/hbase-hbck2/target/hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ./bin/hbase org.apache.hbase.HBCK2 -skip assigns 725a0fe6c2c869d3d0a9ed82bfa80fa3
```

If the invocation comes back with ‘Connection refused’, is the Master up? The Master will shut down after a while if it can’t initialize itself. Just restart the cluster/master and rerun the above assigns command.

When the assigns runs successfully, you’ll see it emit the likes of the following. The ‘48’ on the end is the pid of the assign procedure schedule. If the pid returned is ‘-1’, then the  master startup has not progressed sufficently… retry. Or, the encoded regionname is incorrect. Check.
```
$  HBASE_CLASSPATH_PREFIX=~/checkouts/hbase-operator-tools/hbase-hbck2/target/hbase-hbck2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ./bin/hbase org.apache.hbase.HBCK2 -skip assigns 725a0fe6c2c869d3d0a9ed82bfa80fa3
18:40:43.817 [main] WARN  org.apache.hadoop.util.NativeCodeLoader - Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable
18:40:44.315 [main] INFO  org.apache.hbase.HBCK2 - hbck support check skipped
[48]
``````

Check the master logs. The master should have come up. You’ll see successful completion of pid=48. Look for a line like this to verify successful master launch:
```
master.HMaster: Master has completed initialization 132.515sec
```
It might take a while to appear.

The rebuild of _hbase:meta_ adds the user tables in _DISABLED_ state and the regions in _CLOSED_ mode. Reenable tables via the shell to bring all table regions back online.
Do it one-at-a-time or see the `enable_all ".*"` command to enable all tables in one shot.

The rebuild meta will likely be missing edits and may need subsequent repair and cleaning using facility outlined higher up in this README.

### Dropped reference files, missing hbase.version file, and corrupted hfiles

_HBCK2_ can check for hanging references and corrupt hfiles. You can ask it to sideline bad files which may be needed to get over humps where regions won't online or reads are failing. See the _filesystem_ command in the _HBCK2_ listing. Pass one or more tablename (or 'none' to check all tables). It will report bad files. Pass the _--fix_ option to effect repairs.

### Procedure Start-over

At an extreme, as a last resource, if the Master is distraught and all
attempts at fixup only turn up undoable locks or Procedures that won't finish, and/or
the set of MasterProcWALs is growing without bound, it is
possible to wipe the Master state clean. Just move aside the
_/hbase/MasterProcWALs/_ directory under your hbase install and
restart the Master process. It will come back as a `tabula rasa` without
memory of the bad times past.

If at the time of the erasure, all Regions were happily
assigned or offlined, then on Master restart, the Master should
pick up and continue as though nothing happened. But if there were Regions-In-Transition
at the time, then the operator will have to intervene to bring outstanding
assigns/unassigns to their terminal point. Read the _hbase:meta_
_info:state_ columns as described above to figure what needs
assigning/unassigning. Having erased all history moving aside
the _MasterProcWALs_, none of the entities should be locked so
you are free to bulk assign/unassign.
